## Notes

Some challenges I encountered while building the app:

- Component Import/Export Errors: At first, I ran into issues with correctly importing and exporting components (MuseumCard, MuseumList, etc.). I had to carefully check named exports, and make sure my import paths matched the folder structure.

- Using .map() Correctly: When rendering the list of museums, I initially had errors with the .map() function. I learned that each child in a list needs a unique key prop, and that I needed to pass the entire museum object down to the MuseumCard component.

- Prop Naming and Passing: I also had mistakes where the prop names didnâ€™t match between parent and child components (e.g., passing museums vs. museum).
